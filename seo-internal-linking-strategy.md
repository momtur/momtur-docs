# Internal Linking Strategy for Momtur Website

## Overview
Strategic internal linking improves SEO, user navigation, and conversion rates by creating logical content connections and distributing page authority.

## Link Architecture

### 1. Hub Pages (High Priority)
These pages should receive the most internal links:

#### Primary Hubs
- **Homepage** (`/`) - Link from all pages
- **Airport Transfer Service** (`/services/airport-transfer`) - Core service
- **Bodrum Transfer** (`/bodrum-transfer`) - Main location hub
- **Services Index** (`/services`) - Service category hub

#### Secondary Hubs  
- **Milas-Bodrum Airport** (`/airports/milas-bodrum`)
- **Popular Places** (`/places/popular-places`)
- **About Us** (`/about`)
- **Contact** (`/contact`)

### 2. Linking Patterns

#### Service Pages Should Link To:
```markdown
- Related services (3-4 links)
- Relevant airport pages
- Popular destination pages
- Vehicle type pages
- Booking/Contact page
- FAQ page
```

#### Location Pages Should Link To:
```markdown
- Nearest airport page
- Related location pages (nearby areas)
- Relevant service pages
- Popular venues in that location
- Transfer time/pricing information
```

#### Hotel/Restaurant Pages Should Link To:
```markdown
- Location page where venue is situated
- Airport transfer service
- Special occasion services
- Other venues in same area (2-3)
- Group transfer services
```

### 3. Contextual Link Examples

#### For Service Pages:
```markdown

[luxury vehicle fleet](/vehicles). We serve all areas including 
[Yalıkavak](/locations/bodrum/yalikavak), [Türkbükü](/locations/bodrum/turkbuku), 
and [Göltürkbükü](/locations/bodrum/golturkbuku).
```

#### For Location Pages:
```markdown

[Milas-Bodrum Airport](/airports/milas-bodrum). Popular venues include 
[Maçakızı](/places/macakizi) and [Xuma Beach](/places/xuma-beach).

```

#### For Hotel Pages:

45 minutes from [Bodrum Airport](/airports/milas-bodrum). We offer 
[special event transfers](/services/event-transfers) and 
[corporate transportation](/services/corporate-transportation) services.
```

## Link Distribution Strategy

### Maximum Links Per Page Type
- **Long-form content** (>1000 words): 15-20 internal links
- **Medium content** (500-1000 words): 8-12 internal links  
- **Short content** (less than 500 words): 4-6 internal links

### Link Placement Priority
1. **First paragraph** - 1-2 contextual links to main services
2. **Main content body** - Natural contextual links
3. **Service details section** - Links to related services
4. **Bottom section** - Related pages/services
5. **Sidebar/Navigation** - Category and hub links

## Anchor Text Strategy

### Best Practices
- Use **descriptive anchor text** (not "click here")
- Include **target keywords** naturally
- Vary anchor text for same destination
- Match user search intent

### Examples of Good Anchor Text:
✅ "Bodrum airport transfer service"
✅ "luxury vehicles for VIP transportation"
✅ "45-minute transfer from Bodrum Airport"
✅ "book your Yalıkavak transfer"

### Avoid:
❌ "click here"
❌ "read more"
❌ "this page"
❌ Over-optimized exact match anchors
