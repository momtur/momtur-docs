## Nearest Airport to Karaburun

### 2. Shared Shuttle Services

While potentially more economical, shared shuttles involve multiple stops to drop off other passengers, extending your travel time significantly. They also operate on fixed schedules, which might not align with your flight.

### 3. Public Transportation

Combining public transport options like airport buses to Izmir city center and then local buses to Karaburun is the most budget-friendly choice but also the most time-consuming and cumbersome, especially if you have luggage. This option is not recommended for a direct and comfortable journey.
