## Professional Competency Certificates: The Key to Professionalism in Transfer Services

At Momtur, we position ourselves not just as a transfer service provider, but as your dedicated **'Partner for Private Tours and Chauffeured Ground Transportation'** in and around Bodrum. Therefore, ensuring all our drivers possess the necessary professional competency documents in accordance with the Road Transport Regulation is the cornerstone of our service quality and passenger safety.

### SRC 2 and SRC 4 Certificates: The Foundation of Professional Transportation

Within the scope of the Road Transport Regulation, drivers of commercial vehicles are required to have different professional competency documents depending on the type of cargo or passengers they transport:

**SRC 2 Certificate:** This is a mandatory professional competency certificate for drivers who will be engaged in domestic passenger transportation. With this certificate, they can transport passengers between cities using vehicles such as taxis, minibuses, and buses. This document is a **significant assurance** that ensures our guests travel safely, especially in tourism-rich regions like Bodrum.

**SRC 4 Certificate:** This is a mandatory professional competency certificate for drivers who will be engaged in domestic freight and cargo transportation. With this certificate, they can transport goods within the country using vehicles such as trucks, vans, semi-trailers, and pickups.

### Psychotechnical Certificate: The Psychological and Physical Dimension of Safety

The psychotechnical certificate is a report indicating that drivers are physically and psychologically healthy. According to Article 36-d of the Road Transport Regulation, it is **mandatory for drivers to obtain this report from authorized health institutions every five years**, showing they are physically and psychotechnically fit for the driving profession.

The regular renewal of this certificate is required, considering the possibility that long journeys and years of driving may have worn out the drivers. This is intended to prevent any disasters in traffic and to **ensure the maximum safety** of our guests.

### Acquisition Process and Validity Periods of the Certificates

#### SRC Certificates:
To obtain SRC certificates, drivers must:
- Apply to the Ministry of Transport.
- Undergo training for a specified period (36 hours for domestic transportation).
- Successfully pass the required exam.

Currently, there are no renewal requirements for SRC 2 and SRC 4 certificates, but there is a possibility of changes in the legislation.

#### Psychotechnical Certificate:
To obtain a psychotechnical certificate, drivers must:
- Apply to authorized health institutions.
- Undergo tests that assess psychological and physical functions.
- These tests measure behavior and reactions in situations involving memory, speed control, and aggression.
- The certificate must be renewed every 5 years.
