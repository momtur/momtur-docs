# Bodrum Transportation Guide

Bodrum is a peninsula waiting to be discovered with its beautiful bays, towns, and historical sites. To fully enjoy your holiday, it's important to plan your transportation options well. This guide covers all transportation alternatives starting from Milas-Bodrum Airport and within the peninsula.

## 1. Airport Transfers: Start Your Holiday in Comfort

Milas-Bodrum Airport (BJV) is the main gateway to the peninsula and is approximately 36 km from the center of Bodrum.
